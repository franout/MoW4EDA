# The designs folder
The design folder contains the RT-level designs used in the MoW4EDA flow.

They can be links to external repositories, submodules, or internal design files.

Optionally, the designs folder can include the libs folder, which contains any custom libraries required by the designs (for example required by the synthesis flow).
